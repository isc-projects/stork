Stork consumed all available memory. After the fix, the memory usage is on the
standard level but the CPU usage is still very high. It causes the test to take
so much time that it exceeds the default database timeouts and may freeze the
host system. It is disabled for this reason and because it doesn't check any
particular feature. Additionally, it is prone to the problem with too long
loading big Kea configuration. But it is still useful to run it manually to
reproduce the situation when the Stork server overuses the CPU resources."""
