def _construct_inspect_format(properties: Tuple[str, ...]) -> str:
    """
    Prepares the format string in Docker (Go Templates) format.
    The properties with question mark at the end are optional. It means
    that Docker inspect will not raise exception if they are missing.
    The property prepended with the "json" keyword will be serialized to JSON
    format.

    The constructed format string is cached to improve the performance. It
    causes that the properties container must be hashable.

    The property values will be delimited by the `_INSPECT_DELIMITER` delimiter.
    None values will be indicated by the `_INSPECT_NONE_MARK` special value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    properties : tuple[str]
        Paths to properties to fetch

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The Docker inspect format string

    Notes
    -----
    Thread safety: The function is pure. It has the same output for the same
    input. But access to the cache isn't synchronized (yet).
    Race may happen, but it shouldn't have any adverse effects.

    The cache isn't limited. We expect the function to be used with a small,
    fixed set of properties.

    This cache solution seems to be significant faster the `functools.lru_cache`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> _construct_inspect_format([".State.Status", ".State.Optional?.Status", "json .State.Complex"])
    {{ .State.Status }};{{ if index .State "Optional" }}{{ .State.Optional.Status }}{{ else }}<@NONE@>{{ end }}{{ json .State.Complex }}
