Stork Administrator Reference Manual
####################################

Stork is an open source monitoring application and dashboard for
ISC's Kea DHCP; eventually it will be extended to provide similar
functionality for ISC's BIND 9. It is the spiritual
successor of the earlier projects Kittiwake and Anterius.

This is the reference guide for Stork version |release|. Links to
the most up-to-date version of the Stork ARM document,
along with other Stork resources, can be found on ISC's `Stork project homepage
<https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork>`_ or at `Read the Docs
<https://stork.readthedocs.io>`_ .
