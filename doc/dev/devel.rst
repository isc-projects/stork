Developer's Guide

Rakefile
========

Rakefile is a script for performing many development tasks, like
building source code, running linters and unit tests, and running
Stork services directly or in Docker containers.

There are several other Rake targets. For a complete list of available
tasks, use ``rake -T``. For an extended description of a particular task use
``rake -D name-of-the-task``. Also see the Stork `wiki
<https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork/-/wikis/Processes/development-Environment#building-testing-and-running-stork>`_
for detailed instructions.

Generating Documentation
========================

To generate documentation, simply type ``rake build:doc``.
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `rtd-theme
<https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_ must be installed. The
generated documentation will be available in the ``doc/build``
directory.

ChangeLog
=========

To avoid the merge conflict on the ChangeLog file, we introduced in Stork an
experimental way to update this file.

The ChangeLog entry related to a particular merge request is no longer added
directly to the ``ChangeLog.md`` file. Instead of it, the changelog note should
be saved in a new file in the ``/changelog_unreleased`` directory. The name of
the file should include the GitLab issue number to ensure the filename is
unique for all merge requests.

The content of the file should omit the entry number. The format is:

.. code-block::

    [* optional asterisk, it doesn't affect anything]
    [! if the changes are backward incompatible] [category] [author]
    [empty line]
        [multi-line description, indented]
        [GL issue number, indented]
    [optional empty line]

The GitLab issue number must be constructed as follows:

.. code-block::

    (Gitlab #XXXX)

where ``XXXX`` is the GitLab issue number.

Example:

.. code-block::

    [build] slawek

        Changed the convention of preparing the ChangeLog file to avoid merge
        request conflicts on this file.
        (Gitlab #1120)

The entries are merged on release by the ``rake release:changelog`` task that
is called by the ``rake release:bump`` task usually used in the release process.
The release engineer commits the updated ``ChangeLog.md`` file (with the merged
unreleased entries) and deletes content of the ``changelog_unreleased``
directory.

Setting Up the Development Environment
======================================

The following steps install Stork and its dependencies natively,
i.e., on the host machine, rather than using Docker images.

First, PostgreSQL must be installed. This is OS-specific, so please
follow the instructions from the :user:`Installation
<install.html#installation-prerequisites>`
chapter in Stork ARM, in particular the section about Installation Prerequisites
and follow-up sections.

Once the database environment is set up, the next step is to build all
the tools. The first command below downloads some missing dependencies
and installs them in a local directory. This is done only once
and is not needed for future rebuilds, although it is safe to rerun
the command.

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake build:backend
    $ rake build:ui

The environment should be ready to run. Open three consoles and run
the following three commands, one in each console:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake run:server

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake build:ui_live

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake run:agent

Once all three processes are running, connect to http://localhost:8080
via a web browser. See Usage in Stork ARM for information on initial password creation
or addition of new machines to the server.

The ``run:agent`` runs the agent directly on the current operating
system, natively; the exposed port of the agent is 8888.

There are other Rake tasks for running preconfigured agents in Docker
containers. They are exposed to the host on specific ports.

When these agents are added as machines in the Stork server UI,
both a localhost address and a port specific to a given container must
be specified. The list of containers can be found in the
:ref:`docker_containers_for_development` section.

Updating dependencies
---------------------

There are useful rake tasks for updating dependencies: `update:ui_deps`,
`update:python_requirements`, `update:backend_deps`, `update:ruby_gemfiles`,
`update:angular`. More may be added in the future. For a full list of available
update tasks please use the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake -T update

Installing Git Hooks
--------------------

There is a simple git hook that inserts the issue number in the commit
message automatically; to use it, go to the ``utils`` directory and
run the ``git-hooks-install`` script. It copies the necessary file
to the ``.git/hooks`` directory.

Docker plugins
--------------

Build system utilizes below Docker plugins. They are used in specific tasks
related to Dockerfiles.

- docker compose
- docker buildx

They must be manually installed in the operating system. We support these
plugins as standalone executables (old approach) and as subcommands of the
Docker command (new approach). The form of the plugin depends on the installed
Docker version.

The Docker ``compose`` plugin is used to run the containers of the demo and the
system tests.

The Docker ``buildx`` plugin is used for the cross-architecture building of the
CI Docker images.

The Docker plugins can be defined as prerequisites in the Rake tasks by passing
the subcommand name (new approach) and the executable name (old approach) to
the ``docker_plugin`` function.

.. code-block:: ruby

    DOCKER_COMPOSE = docker_plugin("docker-compose", "compose")

These prerequisites can be set as task dependencies as any other prerequisites.

.. code-block:: ruby

    task :build => [DOCKER_COMPOSE]

But these prerequisites must be passed to the ``sh`` call using the splat
(``*``) operator.

.. code-block:: ruby

    sh(*DOCKER_COMPOSE, "build")

Agent API
=========

The connection between ``stork-server`` and the agents is established using
gRPC over http/2. The agent API definition is kept in the
``backend/api/agent.proto`` file. For debugging purposes, it is
possible to connect to the agent using the `grpcurl
<https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl>`_ tool. For example, a list
of currently provided gRPC calls may be retrieved with this command:

.. code:: console

    $ grpcurl -plaintext -proto backend/api/agent.proto localhost:8888 describe
    agentapi.Agent is a service:
    service Agent {
      rpc detectServices ( .agentapi.DetectServicesReq ) returns ( .agentapi.DetectServicesRsp );
      rpc getState ( .agentapi.GetStateReq ) returns ( .agentapi.GetStateRsp );
      rpc restartKea ( .agentapi.RestartKeaReq ) returns ( .agentapi.RestartKeaRsp );
    }

Specific gRPC calls can also be made. For example, to get the machine
state, use the following command:

.. code:: console

    $ grpcurl -plaintext -proto backend/api/agent.proto localhost:8888 agentapi.Agent.getState
    {
      "agentVersion": "0.1.0",
      "hostname": "copernicus",
      "cpus": "8",
      "cpusLoad": "1.68 1.46 1.28",
      "memory": "16",
      "usedMemory": "59",
      "uptime": "2",
      "os": "darwin",
      "platform": "darwin",
      "platformFamily": "Standalone Workstation",
      "platformVersion": "10.14.6",
      "kernelVersion": "18.7.0",
      "kernelArch": "x86_64",
      "hostID": "c41337a1-0ec3-3896-a954-a1f85e849d53"
    }

RESTful API
===========

The primary client of the RESTful API is the Stork UI in a web browser. The
definition of the RESTful API is located in the ``api`` folder and is
described in Swagger 2.0 format.

The description in Swagger is split into multiple files. Two files
comprise a tag group:

* \*-paths.yaml - defines URLs
* \*-defs.yaml - contains entity definitions

All these files are combined by the ``yamlinc`` tool into a single
Swagger file, ``swagger.yaml``, which then generates the code
for:

* the UI fronted by swagger-codegen
* the backend in Go lang by go-swagger

All these steps are accomplished by Rakefile.

Backend Unit Tests
==================

There are unit tests for the Stork agent and server backends, written in Go.
They can be run using Rake:

.. code:: console

          $ rake unittest:backend

This requires preparing a database in PostgreSQL.

One way to avoid doing this manually is by using a Docker container with PostgreSQL,
which is automatically created when running the following Rake task:

.. code:: console

          $ rake unittest:backend_db

This task spawns a container with PostgreSQL in the background, which
then runs unit tests. When the tests are completed, the database is
shut down and removed.

A subset of tests can be run using ``TEST`` variable. This is a wildcard pattern
that must match (case-sensitive) with test names. For example, to run many BIND
related tests, one can run: ``rake unittest:backend TEST=Bind``. Another way to
run a subset of tests is to use ``SCOPE`` variable, which specified which
package to use. This is a directory related to ``backend/``. For example, to run
all agent tests, one can run: ``rake unittest:backend SCOPE=./agent``.

Unit Tests Database
-------------------

When a Docker container with a database is not used for unit tests, the
PostgreSQL server must be started. The `storktest` role will be
created automatically using the `postgres` user and the `postgres` database as
a maintenance database. If you use different maintenance user or database,
you can specify by the `DB_MAINTENANCE_USER` and `DB_MAINTENANCE_NAME`
environment variables.

.. code-block:: shell

    rake unittest:backend DB_MAINTENANCE_USER=user DB_MAINTENANCE_NAME=db

The maintenance credentials are also used to create the test databases.

To point unit tests to a specific database server via HTTP, set the ``DB_HOST``
and optionally ``DB_PORT`` environment variables, e.g.:

.. code:: console

          $ rake unittest:backend DB_HOST=host DB_PORT=port

There is a shorthand to set the host and port. The ``DB_HOST`` may include the
port delimited by a colon.

.. code:: console

          $ rake unittest:backend DB_HOST=host:port

If the ``DB_HOST`` is not provided, the default Postgres socket is used. The
default port is 5432.

You may need to manually specify the socket if your setup uses a custom socket
location or if multiple database servers are installed.

.. code:: console

        $ rake unittest:backend DB_HOST=/tmp DB_PORT=5433

Notice that the ``DB_HOST`` is a path to the directory containing the socket
file, not to the socket file itself.

If the database setup requires a password other than the default ``storktest``,
the console will prompt for credentials. The default password can also
be overridden with the ``DB_PASSWORD`` environment variable:

.. code:: console

          $ rake unittest:backend DB_PASSWORD=secret123

Note that there is no need to create the ``storktest`` database manually; it is
created and destroyed by the Rakefile task.

Unit Tests Database Authentication
----------------------------------

A few special test cases check if Stork is operational for various database
authentication methods: ``trust``, ``peer``, ``ident``, ``md5``, and
``scram-sha-256``.
These tests require meeting certain conditions to be run. If any of them is
not satisfied, the test case is skipped.

To test the ``trust`` authentication method, you need to add a rule in the
``pg_hba.conf`` file to allow login of the ``${DB_USER}_trust`` user (where
``${DB_USER}`` is a value of the ``DB_USER`` environment variable or
``--db-user`` flag).

To test the `peer` authentication,  you need to add a rule in the
``pg_hba.conf`` file to allow login with a user name the same as the system
user name of the user that runs the tests. Additionally, the database host must
be a socket path (it must be a local connection).

To test the `ident` authentication,  you need to add a rule in the
``pg_hba.conf`` file to allow login with a user name the same as the system
user name of the user that runs the tests. Additionally, the database host
cannot be a socket path (it cannot be a local connection), and the ident
service (compliant with RFC 1413) must be run on the machine that runs the
tests.

To test the ``md5`` authentication method, you need to add a rule in the
``pg_hba.conf`` file to allow login of the ``${DB_USER}_md5`` user (where
``${DB_USER}`` is a value of the ``DB_USER`` environment variable or
``--db-user`` flag).

To test the ``scram-sha-256`` authentication method, you need to add a rule in
the ``pg_hba.conf`` file to allow login of the ``${DB_USER}_scram-sha-256``
user (where ``${DB_USER}`` is a value of the ``DB_USER`` environment variable
or ``--db-user`` flag).

Unit Tests Coverage
-------------------

A coverage report is presented once the tests have executed. If
coverage of any module is below a threshold of 35%, an error is
raised.

Benchmarks
----------

Benchmarks are part of backend unit tests. They are implemented using the
golang "testing" library and they test performance-sensitive parts of the
backend. Unlike unit tests, the benchmarks do not return pass/fail status.
They measure average execution time of functions and print the results to
the console.

In order to run unit tests with benchmarks, the ``BENCHMARK`` environment
variable must be specified as follows:

.. code:: console

          $ rake unittest:backend BENCHMARK=true

This command runs all unit tests and all benchmarks. Running benchmarks
without unit tests is possible using the combination of the ``BENCHMARK`` and
``TEST`` environment variables:

.. code:: console

          $ rake unittest:backend BENCHMARK=true TEST=Bench

Benchmarks are useful to test the performance of complex functions and find
bottlenecks. When working on improving the performance of a function, examining a
benchmark result before and after the changes is a good practice to ensure
that the goals of the changes are achieved.

Similarly, adding new logic to a function often causes performance
degradation, and careful examination of the benchmark result drop for that
function may drive improved efficiency of the new code.

Short Testing Mode
------------------

It is possible to filter out long-running unit tests, by setting the ``SHORT``
variable to ``true`` on the command line:

.. code:: console

          $ rake unittest:backend SHORT=true


Web UI Unit Tests
=================

Stork offers web UI tests, to take advantage of the unit tests generated automatically
by Angular. The simplest way to run these tests is by using Rake tasks:

.. code:: console

   rake unittest:ui

The tests require the Chromium (on Linux) or Chrome (on Mac) browser. The ``rake unittest:ui``
task attempts to locate the browser binary and launch it automatically. If the
browser binary is not found in the default location, the Rake task returns an
error. It is possible to set the location manually by setting the ``CHROME_BIN``
environment variable; for example:

.. code:: console

   export CHROME_BIN=/usr/local/bin/chromium-browser
   rake unittest:ui

By default, the tests launch the browser in headless mode, in which test results
and any possible errors are printed in the console. However, in some situations it
is useful to run the browser in non-headless mode because it provides debugging features
in Chrome's graphical interface. It also allows for selectively running the tests.
Run the tests in non-headless mode using the ``DEBUG`` variable appended to the ``rake``
command:

.. code:: console

   rake unittest:ui DEBUG=true

That command causes a new browser window to open; the tests run there automatically.

The tests are run in random order by default, which can make it difficult
to chase individual errors. To make debugging easier by always running the tests
in the same order, click "Debug" in the new Chrome window, then click
"Options" and unset the "run tests in random order" button. A specific test can
be run by clicking on its name.

.. code:: console

    TEST=src/app/ha-status-panel/ha-status-panel.component.spec.ts rake unittest:ui

By default, all tests are executed. To run only a specific test file,
set the "TEST" environment variable to a relative path to any ``.spec.ts``
file (relative to the project directory).

When adding a new component or service with ``ng generate component|service ...``, the Angular framework
adds a ``.spec.ts`` file with boilerplate code. In most cases, the first step in
running those tests is to add the necessary Stork imports. If in doubt, refer to the commits on
https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork/-/merge_requests/97. There are many examples of ways to fix
failing tests.

System Tests
============

Stork system tests interact with its REST API to ensure proper server behavior,
error handling, and stable operation for malformed requests. Depending on the
test case, the system testing framework can automatically set up and run Kea
or Bind9 daemons and the Stork Agents the server will interact with during the
test. It runs these daemons inside the Docker containers.

Dependencies
------------
System tests require:

- Linux or macOS operating system (Windows and BSD were not tested)
- Python3
- Rake (as a launcher)
- Docker
- `docker compose (V2) <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/>`_ or docker-compose (V1) >= 1.28

Initial steps
-------------

A user must be a member of the ``docker`` group  to run the system tests.
The following commands create create this group and add the current user
to it on Linux.

1. Create the docker group.

.. code:: console

    $ sudo groupadd docker

2. Add your user to the ``docker`` group.

.. code:: console

    $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

3. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

Running System Tests
--------------------

After preparing all the dependencies, the tests can be started
using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake systemtest

This command first prepares all necessary toolkits (except these listed above)
and configuration files. Next, it calls ``pytest``, a Python testing framework
used in Stork for executing the system tests.

..
    <Remove the comment when the system tests will support subscriber Kea hooks.>

    Some test cases use the subscriber Kea hooks. They are disabled by default. To
    enable them, specify the valid `cloudsmith.io <https://cloudsmith.io>`_ access token in the
    CS_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN variable.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ rake systemtest CS_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access token>

Test results for individual test cases are shown at the end of the tests execution.

.. warning::

    Users should not attempt to run the system tests by directly calling pytest
    because it would bypass the step to generate the necessary configuration files.
    This step is conducted by the rake tasks.

To run a particular test case, specify its name in the TEST variable:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake systemtest TEST=test_users_management

To list available tests without actually running them, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake systemtest:list

To run the test cases with a specific Kea version, provide it in the KEA_VERSION variable:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake systemtest KEA_VERSION=2.4
    $ rake systemtest KEA_VERSION=2.4.0
    $ rake systemtest KEA_VERSION=2.4.0-isc20230630120747

Accepted version format is: ``MAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH][-REVISION]``. The version must
contain at least major and minor components.

Similarly, to run test cases with a specific BIND9 version, provide it in the BIND9_VERSION variable:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake systemtest BIND9_VERSION=9.16

Expected version format is: ``MAJOR.MINOR``.

System Tests Framework Structure
--------------------------------

The system tests framework is located in the tests/system directory
that has the following structure:

- ``config`` - the configuration files for specific docker-compose services
- ``core`` - implements the system tests logic, docker-compose controller, wrappers for interacting with the services, and integration with ``pytest``
- ``openapi_client`` - an autogenerated client interacting with the Stork Server API
- ``test-results`` - logs from the last tests execution
- ``tests`` - the test cases (in the files prefixed with the ``test_``)
- ``conftest.py`` - defines hooks for ``pytest``
- ``docker-compose.yaml`` - the docker-compose services and networking

System Test Structure
---------------------

Let's consider the following test:

.. code-block:: python

    from core.wrappers import Server, Kea

    def test_search_leases(kea_service: Kea, server_service: Server):
        server_service.log_in_as_admin()
        server_service.authorize_all_machines()

        data = server_service.list_leases('192.0.2.1')
        assert data['items'][0]['ipAddress'] == '192.0.2.1'

The system tests framework runs in the background and maintains the
docker-compose services that contain different applications. It provides the
wrappers to interact with them using a domain language. They are the
high-level API and encapsulate the internals of the docker-compose and other
applications. The following line:

.. code-block:: python

    from core.wrappers import Server, Kea

imports the typings for these wrappers. Importing them is not necessary to
run the test case, but it enables the hints in IDE, which is very convenient
during the test development.

The next line:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_search_leases(kea_service: Kea, server_service: Server):

defines the test function. It uses the arguments that are handled by the ``pytest``
fixtures. There are four fixtures:

- ``kea_service`` - it starts the container with Kea daemon(s) and Stork Agent.
  If no fixture argument is specified (see later), it also runs the Stork Server
  containers and performs the Stork Agents registration.
  The default configuration is described by the ``agent-kea`` service in the
  ``docker-compose`` file.
- ``server_service`` - it starts the container with Stork Server. The default
  configuration is described by the ``server`` service in the ``docker-compose``
  file.
- ``bind9_service`` - it starts the container with the Bind9 daemon and Stork Agent.
  If not fixture argument was used (see later), it runs also the Stork Server
  containers and Agent registers. The default configuration is described by
  the ``agent-kea`` service in the ``docker-compose`` file.
- ``perfdhcp_service`` - it provides the container with the ``perfdhcp`` utility.
  The default configuration is described by the ``perfdhcp`` service in the
  ``docker-compose`` file.

If the fixture is required, the specified container is automatically built and run.
The test case is executed only when the service is operational - it means it is
started and healthy (i.e., the health check defined in the Docker image passes).
The containers are stopped and removed, and the logs are fetched after the test.

Only one container of a given kind can run in the current version of the system
tests framework.

.. code-block:: python

        server_service.log_in_as_admin()
        server_service.authorize_all_machines()

Test developers should use the methods provided by the wrappers to interact with
the services. Typical operations are already available as functions.

Use ``server_service.log_in_as_admin()`` to login as an administrator and start
the session. Subsequent requests will contain the credentials in the cookie file.

The ``server_service.authorize_all_machines()`` fetches all unauthorized
machines and authorizes them. They are returned by the function. The agent
registration is performed during the fixture preparation.

Use the ``server_service.wait_for_next_machine_states()`` to block and wait
until new machine states are fetched and returned.

The server wrapper provides functions to list, search, create, read, update, or
delete the items via the REST API without a need to manually prepare the
requests and parse the responses. For example:

.. code-block:: python

        data = server_service.list_leases('192.0.2.1')

To verify the data returned by the call above:

.. code-block:: python

        assert data['items'][0]['ipAddress'] == '192.0.2.1'


System Tests with a Custom Service
----------------------------------

Test developers should not reconfigure the docker-compose service in a test
case for the following reasons.

- It is slow - stopping and re-running the service The test case should assume
  that the environment is configured.
- It can be unstable - if a service fails to start or is not operational after
  restart; stopping one service may affect another service. Handling
  unexpected situations increases the test case duration and increases its
  complexity.
- It is hard to write and maintain - it is often needed to use regular
  expressions to modify the content of the existing files, create new files
  dynamically, and execute the custom commands inside the container. It
  requires a lot of work, is complex to audit, and is hard to debug.

The definition of the test case environment should be placed in the
``docker-compose.yaml`` file. Use the environment variables, arguments,
and volumes to configure the services. It allows for using static values
and files that are easy to read and maintain.

Three general services should be sufficient for most test cases and can be
extended in more complex scenarios.

1. ``server-base`` - the standard Stork Server. It doesn't use the TLS to
    connect to the database.
2. ``agent-kea`` - it runs a container with the Stork Agent, Kea DHCPv4, and
    Kea DHCPv6 daemons. The agent connects to Kea over IPv4, does not use the
    TLS or the Basic Auth credentials. Kea is configured to provision 3 IPv4
    and 2 IPv6 networks.
3. ``agent-bind9`` - it runs a container with the Stork Agent and Bind9 daemon.

The services can be customized using the ``extends`` keyword. The test case
should inherit the service configuration and apply suitable modifications.

.. note::

    Test cases should use absolute paths to define the volumes. The host paths
    should begin with ``$PWD`` environment variable returning the root project
    directory.

To run your test case with specific services, use the special helpers:

1. ``server_parametrize``
2. ``kea_parametrize``
3. ``bind9_parametrize``

They accept the name of the docker-compose service to use in the first argument:

.. code-block:: python

    from core.fixtures import kea_parametrize

    @kea_parametrize("agent-kea-many-subnets")
    def test_add_kea_with_many_subnets(server_service: Server, kea_service: Kea):
        pass

The Kea and Bind9 helpers additionally accept the ``suppress_registration``
parameter. If it is set to ``True`` the server service is not automatically
started, and the Stork Agent does not try to register.

.. code-block:: python

    from core.fixtures import kea_parametrize

    @kea_parametrize(suppress_registration=True)
    def test_kea_only_fixture(kea_service: Kea):
        pass

.. note::

   It is not supported to test Stork with different Kea or Bind9 versions.
   This feature is under construction.

Prevent Volumes From Modifications By The Container
---------------------------------------------------

The volumes and binds in Docker can be mounted in two modes: read-only and
read-write (the default).

The read-only mode blocks any modifications to the
files in the container. In this case, the error is raised that the file system
is read-only. The read-only mode also disables reflecting the changes made in
the host filesystem to the container filesystem.

The read-write mode allows the container to modify the files in the volume. The
changes made inside the container are immediately reflected in the host
filesystem and vice versa.

The read-write mode must be used in the system tests involving disk writes.
However, the test framework must ensure a proper isolation of the test cases.
Otherwise, the disk writes in some test cases can affect other test cases as
they share the same volume, and the changes are not reverted after the test
case execution. In addition, the files must not remain modified on the host
after the tests execution. The developer may not notice that the files are
modified and commit them to the repository.

We would like to mount the volumes so they are editable in the container but prevent
changes made in the container from being reflected in the host filesystem.
Unfortunately, Docker does not support such a case. However, we implemented a
workaround to achieve the same effect. The volumes may be marked as isolated
and copied to a temporary directory before the test case. The changes made in
the container are reflected only in these temporary copies and don't affect the
original files. The temporary copies are removed after the test case.

To mark the volume as isolated, start its source path with the ``$IPWD``
(isolated-parent-working-directory) environment variable instead of the
``$PWD`` variable. The ``$IPWD`` variable will be replaced by the temporary
directory path (``tests/system/config/.isolated``).

Example of the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file with the isolated volume:

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
      agent-kea:
        volumes:
          - $IPWD/tests/system/config/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf:/etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf

The framework isolates only volumes of the running services (not all of them).
Isolation is triggered by the ``docker compose up`` and ``docker compose run``
commands. Especially, it is not triggered by the ``docker compose exec`` and
``docker compose start`` commands as the volumes are already mounted when these
commands are executed.

A volume is isolated once and shared between several services. The volume and
all applied modifications are preserved across the service restarts. The volume
is removed when the service containers are pruned.

It needs to be considered whether all volumes should be isolated by default.
Currently, only the volumes that are expected to be modified during the test are
isolated. This allows the developer to spot unexpected modifications.

Update Packages in System Tests
-------------------------------
A specialized ``package_service`` docker-compose service is dedicated to
performing system tests related to updating the packages. The service contains
the Stork Server and Stork Agent (without any Kea or Bind daemons) installed
from the CloudSmith packages (instead of the source code).

The installed version can be customized using an ``package_parametrize``
decorator. If not provided, then the latest version will be installed. Using
many different Stork versions in the system tests may impact their execution time.

Using perfdhcp to Generate Traffic
----------------------------------

The ``agent-kea`` service includes an initialized lease database. It should be
enough for most test cases. To generate some DHCP traffic, use the
``perfdhcp_service``.

.. code-block:: python

    from core.wrappers import Kea, Perfdhcp

    def test_get_kea_stats(kea_service: Kea, perfdhcp_service: Perfdhcp):
        perfdhcp_service.generate_ipv4_traffic(
            ip_address=kea_service.get_internal_ip_address("subnet_00", family=4),
            mac_prefix="00:00"
        )

        perfdhcp_service.generate_ipv6_traffic(
            interface="eth1"
        )

Please note above that an IPv4 address is used to send DHCPv4 traffic and an
interface name for the DHCPv6 traffic. There is no easy way to recognize
which Docker network is connected to which container interface.
The system tests use the ``priority`` property to ensure that the networks
are assigned to the consecutive interfaces.

.. code-block:: yaml

    networks:
      storknet:
        ipv4_address: 172.42.42.200
        priority: 1000
      subnet_00:
        ipv4_address: 172.100.42.200
        priority: 500

In the configuration above, the ``storknet`` network should be assigned
to the ``eth0`` (the first) interface, and the ``subnet_00`` network to the
``eth1`` interface. Our experiments show that this assumption works
reliably.

Debugging System Tests
----------------------

The system test debugging may be performed at different levels. You can debug
the test execution itself or connect the debugger to an executable running in
the Docker container.

The easiest approach is to attach the debugger to the running ``pytest`` process.
It can be done using the standard ``pdb`` Python debugger without any custom
configuration, as the debugger is running on the same machine as debugged binary.
It allows you to break the test execution at any point and inject custom commands
or preview the runtime variables.

Another possibility to use the Python debugger is by running the ``pytest``
executable directly by ``pdb``. You need manually call the ``rake systemtest:build``
to generate all needed artifacts before running tests. It's recommended to pass
the ``-s`` and ``-k`` flags to ``pytest``.

Even if the test execution is stopped on a breakpoint, the Docker containers
are still running in the background. You can check their logs using
``rake systemtest:logs SERVICE=<service name>`` or run the console inside the container
by ``rake systemtest:shell SERVICE=<service name>`` where the ``<service name>``
is a service name from the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file (e.g., ``agent-kea``). To check the service status
in the container console, type ``supervisorctl status``. These tools should
suffice to troubleshoot most problems with misconfigured Kea or Bind9 daemons.

It is possible to attach the local debugger to the executable running in the Docker
container for more complex cases. This possibility is currently implemented only
for the Stork Server. To use it, you must be sure that the codebase on a host is
the same as on the container. In system tests, the server is started by the ``dlv``
Go debugger and listens on the 45678 host port. You can use the
``rake utils:connect_dbg`` command to attach the ``gdlv`` debugger.
It is recommended to attach the Python debugger and stop the test
execution first. Then, attach the Golang debugger to the server.

Docker Containers for Development
=================================

To ease development, there are several Docker containers available.
These containers are used in the Stork demo and are fully
described in the `Demo` in the Stork ARM chapter.

The following ``Rake`` tasks start these containers.

.. note::

    It is recommended that these commands be run using a user account without
    superuser privileges, which may require some previous steps to set up. On
    most systems, adding the account to the ``docker`` group should be enough.
    On most Linux systems, this is done with:

    .. code:: console

        $ sudo usermod -aG docker ${user}

    A restart may be required for the change to take effect.

The Kea and BIND 9 containers connect to the Stork Server container by default.
It can be useful for developers to connect them to the locally running server.
You can specify the target server using the SERVER_MODE environment variable with one of the values:

- host - Do not run the server in Docker. Use the local one instead (it must be run separately on the host).
- no-server - Do not run the server.
- with-ui - Run the server in Docker with UI.
- without-ui - Run the server in Docker without UI.
- default - Use the default service configuration from the Docker compose file (default).

For example, to connect the agent from the Docker container to the locally
running Stork Server:

1. Run the Stork Server locally:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake run:server

2. Run a specific agent service with the SERVER_MODE parameter set to ``host``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake demo:up:kea SERVER_MODE=host

3. Check the unauthorized machines page for a new machine

The Stork Agent containers use the Docker hostnames during communication with
Stork Server.  If you use the server running locally, located on the Docker
host, it cannot resolve the Docker hostnames. You need to explicitly provide
the hostname mapping in your ``/etc/hosts`` file to fix it.
You can use the ``rake demo:check_etchosts`` command to check your actual
``/etc/hosts`` and generate the content that needs to be appended.
This task will automatically run if you use ``SERVER_MODE=host`` then you don't
need to call it manually. It's mainly for diagnostic purposes.

Update the Dependencies Specified in the Dockerfiles
----------------------------------------------------

Updating the dependencies specified in the Dockerfiles is a chicken-and-egg
problem. We need to update the base image to check if the new dependencies
are available but we cannot update the base image without updating the
dependencies because some old dependencies may be not available anymore.

We prepared a utility task named ``utils:list_packages_in_dockerfile`` to list
all packages specified in the Dockerfile and their versions available in the
current base image.

Steps to update the dependencies:

1. Update the base image specified in the ``FROM`` directive.
2. Run the script:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ rake utils:list_packages_in_dockerfile DOCKERFILE=/path/to/file.Dockerfile

3. Update the dependencies in the Dockerfile.

.. note::

    The ``utils:list_packages_in_dockerfile`` task is not perfect. It may
    not detect some packages, especially the ones installed from the external
    repositories. It is recommended to check the Dockerfile manually.

Example command output:

.. code-block:: console

    Base image                               Package name                             Current version                Latest version                           Up-to-date

    ubuntu:22.04                             python3-wheel                            0.37.                          0.37.1-2ubuntu0.22.04.1                  true
    ubuntu:22.04                             rake                                     13.                            13.0.6-2                                 true
    ubuntu:22.04                             wget                                     1.21.                          1.21.2-2ubuntu1                          true

The "Base image" is an image or stage name specified in the ``FROM`` directive.
The "Current version" is a version currently specified in the Dockerfile. The
trailing asterisks are trimmed.
The "Latest version" is latest version available in the OS repository.
The "Latest version" indicates if the "Latest version" meets the
"Current version".

Known limitations:

- Each dependency must be specified in a separate line.
- The only supported version operator are ``=`` for ``apt``,
  ``-`` for ``dnf`` / ``yum``, and ``~`` for ``apk``.
- The packages from external repositories (e.g., CloudSmith) are not detected.
- The modifications of the package manager configuration are not considered.
- Supported package managers: ``apt`` (Ubuntu/Debian), ``yum`` (RHEL),
  ``dnf`` (RHEL), ``apk`` (Alpine).
- Overriding the default values of ``ARG`` and ``ENV`` directives is not
  supported.

The example of the expected call package manager in the Dockerfile:

.. code-block:: docker

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        locales=2.35-* \
        python3-pip=22.* \
        python3-setuptools=59.* \
        python3-wheel=0.37.* \
        rake=13.* \
        wget=1.21.*

Packaging
=========

There are scripts for packaging the binary form of Stork. There are
three supported formats: RPM, deb and apk.

The package type is selected based on the OS that executes the command.
Use the ``utils:print_pkg_type`` to get the package type supported by your OS.

Use ``rake build:agent_pkg`` to build the agent package and
``rake build:server_pkg`` for server package. The package binaries are located
in the ``dist/pkgs`` directory.

Stork build system attempts to detect native package format. If multiple tools
are present, e.g., deb and rpm tools on a Debian-based system, a specific
packaging format can be enforced using the PKG_TYPE variable. The available
package types will be prompted on a console.

Internally, these packages are built by `NFPM <https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/>`_.

Storybook
=========

Stork build system has integrated
`Storybook <https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/get-started/introduction>`_ for
development purposes.

    “Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier
    by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time.
    You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack,
    force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.”

    -- Storybook documentation

To run Storybook, type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake storybook

and wait for opening a web browser.

Writing a Story
---------------

To create a new story for a component, create a new file with the ``.stories.ts``
extension in the component's directory. It must begin with the story metadata:

.. code-block:: typescript

    export default {
        title: 'App/JSON-Tree',
        component: JsonTreeComponent,
        decorators: [
            moduleMetadata({
                imports: [PaginatorModule],
                declarations: [JsonTreeComponent],
            }),
        ],
        argTypes: {
            value: { control: 'object' },
            customValueTemplates: { defaultValue: {} },
            secretKeys: { control: 'object', defaultValue: ['password', 'secret'] },
        },
    } as Meta

It specifies a title and the main component of the story.
The declaration of the ``moduleMetadata`` decorator is the key part of the file.
It contains all related modules, components, and services. It should have similar
content to the dictionary passed to the ``TestBed.configureTestingModule`` in a
``.spec.ts`` file.
The ``imports`` list should contain all used PrimeNG modules (including these
from the sub-components) and Angular modules. Unlike in unit tests, you can
use the standard Angular modules instead of the testing modules. Especially:

    - ``HttpClientModule`` instead of ``HttpClientTestingModule`` to work with the HTTP mocks.
    - ``BrowserAnimationsModule`` instead of ``NoopAnimationsModule`` to enable animations.

The ``declarations`` list should contain all Stork-owned components used in the
story. The ``providers`` list should contain all needed services.

.. note::

    There are different ways to mock the services communicating over the REST
    API, but the easiest and most convenient is simply to mock the actual HTTP
    calls.

If your component accepts the arguments, specify them using the ``argTypes``.
It allows you to change their values from the Storybook UI.

.. warning::

    Storybook can discover the component's properties automatically but this
    feature is currently disabled due to the `bug in Storybook for Angular <https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/17004>`_.

Next, create the Story type by passing the component type as generic type:

.. code-block:: typescript

    type Story = StoryObj<JsonTreeComponent>

Finally, create a Story object and provide its arguments:

.. code-block:: typescript

    const Basic: Story = {
        args: {
            key: 'key',
            value: {
                foo: 42
            }
        }
    }

HTTP Mocks
----------

The easiest way to mock the REST API is using the `storybook-addon-mock <https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-mock>`_

The mocked API responses are specified by the ``parameters.mockData`` list that
is a property of the metadata object.

.. note::

    Remember to use ``HttpClientModule`` instead of ``HttpTestingClientModule``
    in the ``imports`` list of the ``moduleMetadata`` decorator.

Toast messages
--------------

The Stork components often use ``MessageService`` to present temporary messages
to the user. The messages are passed into a dedicated, top-level component
responsible for displaying them as temporary rectangles (so-called toasts) in
the upper right corner.
Due to this, the top-level component is associated with no particular component
and does not exist in the isolated Storybook environment.
As a result, the toasts are not presented.

To workaround this problem, the ``toastDecorator`` can be used. It injects
additional HTML while rendering the Story. The extra code contains the top-level
component to handle toasts and ensures they are correctly displayed.

First, you need to import the decorator:

.. code-block:: typescript

    import { toastDecorator } from '../utils.stories'

and append it to the ``decorators`` property of the metadata object:

.. code-block:: typescript

    export default {
        title: ...,
        component: ...,
        decorators: [
            moduleMetadata({
                ...
            }),
            toastDecorator
        ],
        argTypes: ...
    } as Meta

Remember to add the ``MessageService`` to the ``providers`` list of
the ``moduleMetadata`` decorator.

Implementation details
======================

Agent Registration Process
--------------------------

The diagram below shows a flowchart of the agent registration process in Stork.
It merely demonstrates the successful registration path.
The first Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is generated using an existing or new
private key and agent token.
The CSR, server token (optional), and agent token are sent to the Stork server.
A successful server response contains a signed agent certificate, a server CA
certificate, and an assigned Machine ID.
If the agent was already registered with the provided agent token, only the assigned
machine ID is returned without new certificates.
The agent uses the returned machine ID to verify that the registration was successful.

.. figure:: ./static/registration-agent.*

    Agent registration

Build with legacy GLIBC version
-------------------------------

We guarantee that the Stork is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. They are
built with GLIBC 2.31. The newer Ubuntu versions use GLIBC 2.32 or higher.

The GLIBC library is a C-standard library. It is installed by default in the
operating system because many system components depend on it. It causes the
upgrade or downgrade of this library to be very problematic or impossible.

There is an additional complication that not all operating systems use the standard GLIB
distribution. There is an alternative implementation - `musl-libc` - that is
preferred by the operating systems focused on the installation size (e.g.,
Alpine Linux).

The Go binaries compiled with CGO_ENABLED=1 (default) depend on the GLIBC
library installed in the operating system. Disabling CGO causes using a custom
DNS resolving method (internals of the `net` package), a custom system user
profile fetching (internals of the `os/user` package), and blocks loading
plugins. Therefore, using CGO is mandatory in the Stork development.

The older GLIBC versions can be compiled from sources, and the Go compiler can
be configured to use it. However, building GLIBC is a time- and CPU-consuming process.
Additionally, the C linker depends on the GLIBC library, so it must also be
compiled from the sources. We decided not to use this method because it would
significantly increase the build time of Stork and overcomplicate the build
system.

Our idea to build Stork binaries with the old GLIBC version support is to
compile them on the old Ubuntu system. It introduces a new problem because the
Stork build system is no longer compatible with old Ubuntu versions.
Fortunately, the core Go build kit doesn't depend on the operating system
components.
The solution is to compile the binaries on the standard (modern) Ubuntu system
first. It causes the installation of all toolkits and generates all
intermediate files (e.g., OpenAPI clients and DHCP option definitions). Next,
we move the whole Stork directory to the old Ubuntu system and rebuild the Go
binaries. We introduced a new build switch to turn off checking all
prerequisites of the Go binaries. It ensures no other files will be touched or
reinstalled. So, we expect just the Go files to be recompiled with the older
GLIBC version. Then, we move the Go binaries back to the modern Ubuntu system
and continue the build process.

The above flow was implemented in Stork CI only. It is not a part of the standard
build system (the Rake tasks). It was specified only for the DEB and RPM packages
on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.

If you build Stork in your environment, remember the Go compiler uses the GLIBC
library installed in the system, so the output binaries will only be compatible
with operating systems with the same or newer GLIBC version. Please note that
Stork requires modern versions of the third-party toolkits (i.e., Python and
Ruby) that may not be available in the system repositories on the legacy
operating systems. In this case, you need to install them from the official
packages distributed by their maintainers. See
`the documentation <https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork/-/wikis/Install>`_
for details.

Generated Code for DHCP Option Definitions
==========================================

DHCP standard options have well-known formats defined in the RFCs. Stork backend and
frontend are aware of these formats and use them to parse option data received from
Kea and send updated data to Kea. When new options are standardized, the Stork code
must be updated to recognize the new options.

The Stork code includes two identical sets of the DHCP option definitions, one for the
backend and one for the frontend. The first set is defined in the ``backend/appcfg/stdoptiondef4.go``
and ``backend/appcfg/stdoptiondef6.go`` files using the Golang syntax. The second set is
defined in the ``webui/src/app/std-option-defs4.ts`` ``webui/src/app/std-option-defs6.ts``
files using the Typescript syntax. These files should not be modified directly. They
are generated by the ``stork-code-gen`` tool provided with the Stork source code.

To add or modify option definitions, edit the ``codegen/std_dhcpv4_option_def.json`` and
``codegen/std_dhcpv6_option_def.json`` files. They include the definitions of all standard
DHCP options in the portable JSON format. It is the same format in which the definitions
are specified in Kea. Once you update the definitions, build and run the code-generating tool:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake build:code_gen
    $ rake gen:std_option_defs

Make sure that the respective ``.go`` and ``.ts`` files have been properly updated and
formatted to pass the linter checks. Next, commit the new versions of these files.

The ``stork-code-gen`` tool can also be run directly (outside of the Rake build system)
to customize the file names and other parameters.


Linters
=======

There are many linters available for checking and cleaning Stork code. You can get the list with
the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ rake -T | grep lint
    rake hook:lint                          # Lint hooks against the Stork core rules
    rake lint:backend                       # Check backend source code
    rake lint:git                           # Run danger commit linter
    rake lint:python                        # Runs pylint and flake8, python linter tools
    rake lint:python:black                  # Runs black, python linter tool
    rake lint:python:flake8                 # Runs flake8, python linter tool
    rake lint:python:pylint                 # Runs pylint, python linter tool
    rake lint:shell                         # Check shell scripts
    rake lint:ui                            # Check frontend source code


This list will probably be grow over time. ``rake -D`` will produce more detailed description of the tasks.

Some linters can fix simpler formatting errors. There's a group of tasks for this:

.. code-block:: console

  $ rake -T | grep fmt
    rake fmt:backend                        # Format backend source code
    rake fmt:python                         # Format Python source code
    rake fmt:ui                             # Make frontend source code prettier


Some, but not all, take optional ``FIX`` variable. If set to ``true``, the linter will fix specific code.
You may check the details using ``rake -D``. For example, to fix some black (python linter) issues, one
can use ``rake lint:shell FIX=true``.

Conditional build
=================

The Stork build system supports conditional building of the Golang applications
through the use of build tags. The build tags are used to include or exclude
specific parts of the code from the build. The build tags are specified in the
source code files using the ``// +build`` directive.

To build the executable with the specific build tags, specify the file target
in Rakefile following the pattern
``/backend/cmd/[APP_NAME]/[APP_NAME]+[TAG_1]+[TAG_2]``, for example:
``/backend/cmd/stork-server/stork-server+profiler`` - in this case, the
Stork server will be built with the ``profiler`` tag.


.. warning::

    It is strongly recommended to use the build tags only for the development
    purposes. The production builds should not include any additional tags.
    The conditional-enabled code is impossible to cover by the unit or system
    tests because these tests are not aware of the build tags (it is not
    implemented).

This solution can be used to enable profiling, custom debugging, extensive
logging, or any other development features that should not be included in the
production builds.

Performance Profiling and Monitoring
====================================

Stork build system provides several utilities to profile the performance of the
Stork applications that should be suitable in various scenarios.

Profiling the Execution
-----------------------

The Go programming language provides a built-in profiling tool ``pprof`` that
can be used to profile the performance of the Stork applications. The profiling
tool can generate the CPU, memory, and blocking profiles.

.. note::

    The blocking profile tracks time spent blocked on synchronization primitives,
    such as sync.Mutex, sync.RWMutex, sync.WaitGroup, sync.Cond, and channel
    send/receive/select.

To profile a Stork application, first run it using a Rakefile task. The
build system will compile the application with conditionally enabled profiling.
The commands to run the applications are: ``rake run:server_profiling`` and
``rake run:agent_profiling``.

.. note::

    Profiling is enabled only when Stork is started using one of the above
    commands. Production binaries lack tags required for profiling.

Next, the profiler can be attached to the running application using the
following commands: ``rake profile:server`` and ``rake profile:agent``.
By default, they will collect CPU samples for 30 seconds, and the Web UI will
be opened with the profiling results.

.. note::

    The "Flame Graph" view, available in the "View" menu, is especially useful in
    examining the profiling results.

The profiling commands can be customized using the following environment
variables:

- ``PROFILE`` - the type of the profile to collect. The available values are:

  - ``cpu`` (CPU usage)
  - ``allocs`` (number of allocations and memory usage)
  - ``block`` (number of blocks)
  - ``goroutine`` (number of goroutines)
  - ``heap`` (size of the heap)
  - ``mutex`` (number of mutexes)
  - ``threadcreate`` (number of threads created),
  - ``trace`` (execution trace)

- ``DURATION`` - a duration of profiling in seconds.

There are also two exclusive options to analyze deltas between two profiles:
``COMPARE`` and ``SUBSTRACT``. Both accept the path to the profile file
generated earlier. The profile file can be downloaded from the Web UI.

.. warning::

    We did not find options to compare or subtract profiles very useful. The
    report generated looks very similar to the one generated without providing
    the previous profile file. Additionally, the numeric labels don't look very
    reliable. Maybe they need some additional tweaks. We recommend using them
    with caution.

Profiling the Execution Live
----------------------------

Stork has also an option to display the profiling metrics in real time.

First, start the application as described in the previous section.

Next, the profiler can be attached to the running application using the
following commands: ``rake profile:server_live`` and ``rake profile:agent_live``.
The page in the default web browser will be opened.

The data on dashboard present CPU and heap usage, allocations (memory usage),
and active goroutines.

Profiling Unit Tests
--------------------

There is specialized Rake task to profile the unit tests using ``pprof``. It
can be run using the following command: ``rake unittest:backend:profile``.

It requires the ``TEST`` environment variable to specify the test to profile.
It can be an exact name or a regular expression.

A caller also need to specify the ``SCOPE`` environment variable. It must be set
to the subdirectory where the test is located. E.g., for the
``TestGetMachineByAddress`` test located in the
``backend/server/database/model/machine_test.go`` file, the ``SCOPE`` should be
set to ``server/database/model``.

The ``KIND`` environment variable can be set to the profile type. The available
values are:

  - ``cpu`` (CPU usage)
  - ``mem`` (memory usage)
  - ``mutex`` (number of mutexes)
  - ``block`` (number of blocks).

For example:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ rake unittest:backend:profile TEST=TestAddMachine SCOPE="server/database/model" KIND=mem

.. note::

    For small or fast unit tests, the CPU profiling may display blank results
    due to insufficient data. The memory profiling should work better.

Profiling Unit Tests from Visual Studio Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Visual Studio Code and the official Go extension provide a built-in support
for profiling the Go unit tests. You need to install the ``Go`` extension from
the marketplace.

Then, on the left side of the editor, click the ``Testing`` icon (it looks like
a beaker). It will open the testing view. Select the test you want to profile
and click on it with the right mouse button. Choose the ``Go Test: Profile``
option from the context menu. Then, wait for the test to finish and the profile
to be generated. The profile will be displayed inside the editor.

Monitoring System Tests
-----------------------

There is no way to attach the profiler to the running system tests because they
use the production binaries.

Anyway, the Stork system test framework provides a way to monitor performance
of running supervisor-managed services. This feature can be enabled by mounting
as volumes the ``tests/system/tools/supervisor_monitor.py`` script in the
``/usr/lib/supervisor_monitor.py`` location in the Docker container and the
``tests/system/config/supervisor/supervisor_monitor.conf`` Supervisor config
file in the ``/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisor_monitor.conf`` location.

The monitor is already setup for the Kea, BIND 9, and Stork server
docker-compose services. It collects the CPU and memory usage over time of all
Supervisor-managed processes. The collected data are fetched on container exit
and used to generate the performance charts that are available in the system
test results directory. The raw data are available too in the same location.

Collected metrics are:

- ``cpu [%]`` - the percentage of CPU usage
- ``mem [%]`` - the percentage of memory usage according to the all available memory
- ``rss [B]`` - the resident set size (the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used) in bytes
- ``vsz [B]`` - the virtual memory size in bytes

The HTML report displays the charts using the SI-prefixes (e.g., k, M, G) but
it divides the values by 1000, not 1024. The percentage values are also
displayed with the SI-prefixes - so 200m means 200 mili-percent = 0.2%.

Monitoring Demo
---------------

The same monitoring script has been set up for the demo services. They collect
the metrics for the Kea, BIND 9, and Stork agent and server services.
The demo environment must be running while the profiling command is called. You
can start the demo with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake demo:up

The demo environment gathers some performance statistics in the background
continuously. The collected metrics can be viewed on demand using the following
command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rake demo:performance

It fetches the log files from the demo services and generates the performance
charts. The report is opened in the default web browser.

The collected metrics are limited to 20 MB per container to prevent the
excessive disk usage. The log files are rotated when the 10 MB limit is reached.
It is enough to collect the metrics for several hours.
