Stork 2.3.1 released on 2025-10-15.

* 562 [func] piotrek

    Responsive UI was improved. Content overflow was minimized for
    smaller viewports.
    (Gitlab #1528)

* 561 [sec] ! slawek

    Updated Go to version 1.24.8.
    Changed how the Stork server generates GRPC certificates for
    compatibility with the new revision of the cryptographic library
    fixing CVE-2025-58187.
    Stork now filters out the DNS names that are not valid domains when
    preparing the Subject Alternate Name (SAN) certificate field. All
    previously generated certificates are incompatible if they contain
    invalid DNS names that must be fixed by re-registering the Stork
    agents.
    (Gitlab #2035)

* 560 [func] marcin

    BIND 9 configuration parser is used by the Stork agent during
    detection of BIND 9 instances. It is not user-visible change but
    it is explicitly noted here in case it introduces some issues with
    uncommon BIND 9 configurations.
    (Gitlab #1926)

* 559 [bug] slawek

    Fixed a bug in the statistic counting that produced enormous big or
    negative values or crashed due to division by zero.
    (Gitlab #1953)

* 558 [build] piotrek

    Updated frontend dependencies including Angular 19 and PrimeNG 19.

    versions.
    (Gitlab #1760)

* 557 [bug] marcin

    Fixed parsing "dyndb" BIND 9 configuration statement. Previously,
    BIND 9 configuration parsing failed on this statement causing
    issues with detecting BIND 9 servers.
    (Gitlab #1938)

* 556 [build] slawek

    Split Python requirements in separate files for each Python version.
    The Python requirement files are now generated dynamically if they
    do not already exist. This improves building, especially of the UI,
    on systems with old Python versions.
    (Gitlab #1505)

* 555 [func] marcin

    Improved performance of BIND 9 configuration parsing by the agent.
    Added support for annotating parts of the BIND 9 configuration to
    skip parsing them. These annotations are useful in large deployments
    when parsing the BIND 9 configuration file can take significant
    amount of time. Use //@stork:no-parse:scope and
    //@stork:no-parse:end to skip parsing selected part of the
    configuration file. Use //@stork:no-parse:global to skip parsing
    the rest of the configuration file following the annotation.

    Restructured Stork ARM. Created new sections to cover DHCP and
    DNS-specific topics. Described the process of detecting Kea,
    BIND 9 and PowerDNS, and the configuration requirements for the
    DNS servers, so they can be monitored by Stork.
    (Gitlab #1844)

* 551 [sec] slawek

    Added a verification of the size of incoming requests to fix the DoS
    attack vector. Added a patch securing against an integer overflow
    bug in go-pg library (CVE-2024-44905).  This patch prevents
    potential vulnerabilities that could stem from this bug in the
    future.
    (Gitlab #1939, #1940)

    on the machines page and the dashboard.
    (Gitlab #1973)

* 549 [build] marcin

    Improved detection of PowerDNS config file location. The agent
    tries to find the config file in typical locations. Added the
    command line argument (`--powerdns-path`) and environment variable
    (`STORK_AGENT_POWERDNS_CONFIG`) to specify custom PowerDNS config
    file location.

    Options and DHCP Parameters boxes can now be expanded and collapsed.
    (Gitlab #1550)

* 538 [bug] marcin

    The stork-agent gracefully deals with the situation when the
    statistics-channel configuration in BIND 9 lacks the allow
    statement. It logs an error requesting that the allow statement
    is included in the configuration.
    (Gitlab #1908)

* 537 [bug] marcin

    Zone RRs are cached in the database for a viewed zone. It avoids
    repeated zone transfers (AXFR) when showing zone contents. The
    cached zone contents can be refreshed using zone transfer on
    demand by clicking a button in the UI.
    (Gitlab #1909)

* 536 [bug] marcin

    The number of distinct and builtin zones are displayed in the
    dashboard and DNS fetch status pages.
    (Gitlab #1786)

* 535 [bug] marcin

    Root zone is now properly fetched from the agent and stored in the
    database. Previously, fetching the zones from the agent failed
    when the DNS server configuration on the agent's machine included
    a root zone.
    (Gitlab #1870)

* 534 [func] slawek

    The host migrator reports now a missing Kea host_cmds hook as a
    daemon-related error.

    dashboard. Users can control the dashboard's displayed/hidden
    state with the toggle buttons.
    (Gitlab #340)

* 513 [func] tomek, piotrek

    Zone Viewer UI was improved. Two new columns were added to the
    Zone list table: Serial and Zone Type. If Stork detects a serial
    mismatch across different servers or views, a red notification
    will be displayed to draw the user's attention.
    (Gitlab #1768)

* 512 [func] piotrek

    Zone viewer UI was improved. Some table column names were renamed

    of attributes of the system directories on specific operating
    systems.
    (Gitlab #1614)

* 490 [func] marcin

    Implemented a DNS "zone inventory" in the Stork agent. It adds
    the capability for the Stork agent to gather a list of views
    and zones from BIND 9 on startup. This list is stored in the
    agent's memory but is not yet available to the Stork server.
    This change provides no new user-visible capabilities to the
    Stork agent, but lays the foundation for the zone viewer
    feature.
    (Gitlab #1647)

* 489 [doc] slawek, bscott

    Added an LDAP hook documentation.

    dash.
    (Gitlab #1670)

* 483 [func] slawek

    Stork agent now retrieves the Basic Auth credentials from the Kea
    CA configuration file. It is no longer supported to provide the
    JSON file with a login and password to the Kea REST API. The agent
    selects credentials with a "stork" user name or prefix.
    If no user is found, it uses the first credentials entry.
    (Gitlab #1624)

* 482 [func] slawek

    Added an input to alter the subnet name.
    (Gitlab #1641)

* 481 [bug] marcin

    to gracefully handle communication issues between Stork agents and
    Kea servers.
    (Gitlab #1467)

* 480 [func] piotrek

    The feature which informs about used Kea, BIND 9, and Stork versions
    was improved to download the metadata about current software
    releases from an online source. The user may disable this feature in
    settings so the built-in offline JSON file can be used as a metadata
    source instead.
    (Gitlab #1636)

* 479 [func] piotrek

    Anchors to Kea hooks documentation were improved to be automatically
    generated. This way the anchors will be always up-to-date with new

    Solved a problem with consuming abnormally much memory if the Stork
    server monitored multiple Kea servers that simultaneously managed
    thousands of shared networks.
    (Gitlab #1552)

* 470 [func] marcin

    Conditionally set ddns-use-conflict-resolution and
    ddns-conflict-resolution-mode, depending on the configured
    Kea version. Previously a user could set one of these
    parameters for the Kea versions that did not support them,
    causing configuration errors.
    (Gitlab #1536)

* 469 [bug] slawek

* 446 [func] marcin

    Handle the case in Stork statistics presentation when the number
    of declined leases is lower than the number of assigned leases.
    In this case, Stork now estimates the number of leases with
    uncertain availability, and the number of free leases. These

    Fixed a bug in UI of the password change form.
    The problem was when user provided New password containing special
    characters e.g. +. Even though New password and Confirm password
    where identical, form validation was failing and user could not

    number of code changes is significant and thus noted in the ChangeLog.
    (Gitlab #942)

* 285 [bug] tomek

    BIND 9 detection code has been expanded and is now more robust. It now can
    also attempt to look at more default locations for config files, use
    named -V to discover built-in locations and also use STORK_AGENT_BIND9_CONFIG
    to explicitly tell where to look for a BIND9 config file. The detection
    process is also now more verbose. Enabling DEBUG logging level may
    help.
    (Gitlab #831)

* 284 [func] slawek

    Updated Stork demo setup to use new machines registration methods.
    Machines automatically request registration using the agent token
    method. Their registration can be approved in the machines view.
    (Gitlab #485)

* 127 [func] godfryd, tomek, marcin

    Secured agent-server channel part 3. Implemented agent deployment
    using script downloaded from the server. The script installs
    deb/rpm packages with stork agent. Then the script registers
    current machine in the server performing key and certs
    exchange. Enabled TLS to gRPC traffic between agent and server
    using certs that are set up during agent registration. Added
    instruction on machines page how to install an agent. Added UI for
    presenting and regenerating server token.
    (Gitlab #483)

* 126 [func] godfryd

    This is the second part of secured agent-server channel
    implementation. Added code for registering a machine in the server
    and performing key and certs exchange but it is not used fully
    yet. Added server-token and agent-token based agent
    authorizations. Added REST API for presenting and regenerating
    server token, but it is not used in UI yet. Updated content of
    reference agent.env agent config file.
    (Gitlab #481)

* 125 [func] marcin

    Assign friendly names to the apps monitored in Stork. The apps'
    names are auto-generated using the following scheme:
    [app-type]@[machine-address]%[app-unique-id], e.g.,
    kea@machine1.example.org%123. The [app-unique-id] is not appended
    to the name of the first first app of the given type on the
    particular machine. Thus, the name can be kea@machine1.example.org.
    The auto-generated apps' names are presented in the Web UI instead
    of the previously used app ID. The names are not yet editable by a
    user.
    (Gitlab #458)

* 124 [func] godfryd

    The first part of secured agent-server channel implementation.
    Added generating root CA and server keys and certs,
    and server token generation during server startup.

* 122 [func] godfryd

    Migrated command line processing in agent from jessevdk/go-flags
    to urfave/cli/v2. Thanks to this it is possible to define commands
    in command line. Previously only switches were possible in command
    line. This is a preparation for new agent command: register.
    (Gitlab #468)

Stork 0.14.0 released on 2020-12-09.

* 121 [func] marcin

    Events received over SSE and presented on various Stork pages are
    now filtered and only the events appropriate for the current view
    are shown. Prior to this change all events were always shown.
    (Gitlab #429)

* 120 [func] marcin

    When Stork server pulls updated Kea configurations it detects those
    configurations that did not change since last update using a fast
    hashing algorithm. In case when there was no configuration change
    for a daemon, Stork skips processing subnets and/or hosts within
    this configuration. This improves efficiency of the configuration
    pull and update. In addition, when configuration change is detected,
    an event is displayed informing about such change in the web UI.
    (Gitlab #460)

* 119 [doc] tomek

    Prometheus and Grafana integration is now documented. Also, updated
    requirements section pointing out that stat_cmds hook is needed for

* 118 [bug] marcin

    Prevent an issue whereby Stork server would attempt to fetch updated
    machine state while the request to add this machine is still being
    processed. This used to cause data conflict errors in the logs and
    network congestion.

* 116 [perf] marcin

    Improved performance of connecting large Kea installation with many
    subnets to Stork. Adding subnets to the database is now much more
    efficient as it avoids extensive subnet lookups. Instead it uses
    indexing techniques.
    (Gitlab #421)

Stork 0.13.0 released on 2020-11-06.

    adjusted so they take into account DHCP version. This way subnets and
    shared network pages automatically set filtering by protocol version
    based on parameters provided in URL.
    (Gitlab #389)

* 113 [bug] godfryd

    Fixed handling renamed statistics from Kea. In Kea 1.8 some
    of the statistics have been renamed, e.g. total-addresses
    to total-addresses. Now Stork supports both of the cases.
    (Gitlab #413)

* 112 [bug] godfryd

    Fixed handling situation when IP address of Kea Control Agent has
    changed. Till now Stork was not able to detect this and was still
    communicating to the old address. Now it checks if address has
    changed and updates it in the database.
    (Gitlab #409)

* 111 [bug] marcin

    Corrected presentation of the HA state in the dashboard and
    the HA status panel in cases when HA is enabled for a server

LEGEND
* [bug]   General bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
          unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
          compatibility to fix the bug.
* [build] Compilation and installation infrastructure change.
* [doc]   Update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
* [func]  New feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
          change, which would require a bump of major version.
* [sec]   Security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
          fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
          security patch releases.
* [perf]  Performance related change.
* [ui]    User Interface change.
