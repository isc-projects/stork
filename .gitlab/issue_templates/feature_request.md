**Some initial questions**
- Are you sure what you would like to do is not possible using some other mechanisms?
- Stork is in very early stages of development. If your request is not simple, it
  may be a while until anyone does anything with your request. Are you ok with that?

**Funding its development**
Kea is run by ISC, which is a small non-profit organization without any government funding or any
permanent sponsorship organizations. Are you able and willing to participate financially in the
development costs?

**Participating in development**
Are you willing to participate in the feature development? ISC team always tries to make a feature
as generic as possible, so it can be used in wide variety of situations. That means the proposed
solution may be a bit different that you initially thought. Are you willing to take part in the
design discussions? Are you willing to test an unreleased engineering code?

**Contacting you**
How can ISC reach you to discuss this matter further? If you do not specify any means such as
e-mail, jabber id or a telephone, we may send you a message on github with questions when we
have them.
